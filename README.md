Space Y company bidding SpaceX that has an advantage on saving millions by saving the first stage after launch.

**Summary**

Using Data Science methodology, determined the launch success factors and the most accurate classification model to predict launch success, save the first stage of the rocket and save millions.

**Solution**

High accuracy prediction (94.4%) of the launch success (Decision Tree classification model) based on carefully chosen parameters.

**Approach**

Collect and clean the data, data wrangling, data insights through EDA with visualizations and EDA with SQL queries, predictive analysis through 4 ML classification models to find the model that could predict launch success with the highest accuracy based on metrics like score and confusion matrix.
